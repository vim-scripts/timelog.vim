" What:   timelog.vim:  Vim {,ft}plugin for keeping track of one's time.
" Usage:  source the file, or stick it in your ftplugin directory and
"         have ft=timelog on your modeline.
"         Keys:  n new job
"                t go
"                q stop 
"                s[1-9] sort by that column

What is it?
===========

A simple time tracking utility.

Why?
====

I tried karm and gtt and didn't like them.  I find it useful - someone
else might too.

Installation
============

Drop it in ~/vim/ftplugin/.  When you open a file with the modline telling
vim that the filetype is "timelog":

" vim:ft=timelog:

it'll be sourced.  I personally have an alias to check out (RCS) my
timelog file, open it with vim and check it back in when I'm finished.

Usage
=====


Keys:
   n new job
   t start timing highlighted job (or job with the cursor on it)
   q stop timing
   s[1-9] sort by that column


Here's an example of what mine could look like:

" vim:ft=timelog:
" usage:
"   t go
"   q stop
"   n new job
"   s[1-9] sort by that column
" dates in yy-mm-dd time in hh:mm:ss
start     last      time      what?
--------  --------  --------  -------
03-11-03  03-11-03  00:10:23  O  ----    Write doc for timelog.vim 
02-11-19  03-10-19  05:19:02  C  0712    something
02-11-19  02-11-19  00:14:41  C  0977    something else
03-11-03  03-11-03  00:00:00  N  ----    blah

The first 3 columns are what timelog.vim give you - when the job was
created, when it was last modified and time spent on it.  The rest can be
whatever you like.  For me here I have a tag for whether the job is New,
Open or Completed (N, O, C), a reference nuber for the job if I have one
and a description.

There can be several timlog blocks seperated by white space and can have
text between.  Each timelog block can be sorted seperately.

Bugs?
=====

Well, the seconds aren't quite seconds and not all motions highlight the
line the cursor ends up on.
